# Codebook for Project Tidy Data

The Project Tidy Data was created from underlying data from the UCI Machine learning repository. 
The information about the underlying data from which the tidy dataset was created is given at the latter half of this codebook.

This process of creating the Tidy dataset from the underlying dataset is as follows:

My analysis file first creates a directory for the files from the UCI Machine learning repository, then downloads the files to that directory.

Next, I unzip the file and readin the relevant data files

I then stack the test and train versions of the Subject, X (features) and Y (activity) datasets together.

Next, I assign names to these datasets, before combining the Subject, features and activity datasets. I use the names

from features.txt to name the fields in the features dataset.

I then subset a dataset with only the fields with mean() and std() in the field name, as well as the Subject and Activity fields.

I can then merge on the Activity labels on the Activity field using the activity_labels.txt dataset.

I then rename the field names so that they are more descriptive.

Finally, I create a tidy dataset of the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

As a result, the tidy dataset contains the Subject and Activity fields, and the mean by subject and activity of fields from the underlying data which estimated the mean value or standard deviation of a measurement. For more context, a description of the underlying data fields is given here:

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
